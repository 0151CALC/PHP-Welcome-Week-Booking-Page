# PHP-Welcome-Week-Booking-Page
 University 2nd Year Assignment

This was an assignment where we had to create a mock welcome week session booking page for the university. It connected to a database which contained information on what sessions were being hosted and how many people were currently booked and how many spaces there were left.

The page allowed a user to make a booking which in turn updated the database.

This also did checks on the entered name and email to make sure they were valid. This was done though PHP's preg_match function.
